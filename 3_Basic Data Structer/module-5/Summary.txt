Why linked list
1. arry store value in a sequence order, if we have memory but not in sequence then we can store it.
in arry we store
first 120 adress
second 124 add
third 128
if 132 is already used then array can be used in hear, because we have memory but don't have sequencial memory

2.linked list require connection not sequence memory

3.In normal array we need to give size while creating array and we can't chage it later though it solved by dynamic array , In linked list there is no size, we just need to connect one to another
